* The script computeMap.R performs a projection of the spherical coordinates onto a 2D plan. It performs a sinusoidal projection (an equal area projection) of all the spherical coordinates given in input (for more details, see for example http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SinusoidalProjection.html or http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/DSS/ImgHTML/Sinusoidal.html). This script can be useful for example to map your ligand starting orientations around the receptor on a 2D plan, in order to check if your sampling is homogenous and/or exhaustive enough or at the contrary, if it respects your filtering. 

To execute this script, type the following on your terminal:
Rscript computeMap.R               # This is the example test
Rscript computeMap.R -f yourfile   # Execute the script with your file in input. 

- input: File containing a set of (phi, theta) coordinates. Columns 1 contains phi coordinates, column 2 contains theta coordinates (you're free to change this, see l.32-33 in the script). If no argument given, the file example.txt will be automatically used.
REMARK:
Phi coordinates should be comprised between -pi and pi.
Theta coordinates should be comprised between -pi/2 and pi/2.
The R package optparse must be installed.

- output: pdf file with coordinates given in input mapped onto a 2D projection (see file example_map.pdf).

* The file example.txt is a list of ligand starting orientations around the receptor before minimization.

* The file example_map.pdf is an output of computeMap.R, with the file example.txt in input. All ligand positions have been plotted on a 2D map representing the surface of the receptor protein.

* The file sampling.png represents the receptor protein with all the ligand starting orientations (before minimization) used in this example.

With this script you should be able to see if your sampling is exhaustive enough to your taste ;). Of course you are free to use it or not!
