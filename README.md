## Introduction

This scoring method uses the following steps:

- Checking for shape complementarity and steric clashes.
- Knowledge based scoring on amino-acids interactions.
- Electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions scoring.
- Adjusting the weights of the different scoring functions by machine learning.

## Quick start

```
$ ./meetdock pdbfile.pdb
```

## Installation

### Environment - Conda

To ensure the cross-platform reproducibility of this method, we choose to work with a [conda](https://conda.io) environment.

The environment file is available here as [environment.yml](./environment.yml).

#### 1- create the environment from the environment.yml file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### 2- activate the environment

`source activate meetu`

## Documentation

```
$ ./meetdock -h
usage: MeetDockOne [-h] [-shape] [-electro] [-jones] [-proba] [-foldx]
                   [-pH PH] [-depth DEPTH] [-dist DIST]
                   pdbfile
