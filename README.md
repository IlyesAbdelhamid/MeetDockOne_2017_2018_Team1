- Knowledge based scoring on amino-acids interactions
- Electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions scoring.

## Quick start

```pythonM
to complete
```

## Installation

### Environment - Conda

To ensure the cross-platform reproducibility of this method, we choose to work with a [conda](https://conda.io) environment.

The environment file is available here as [environment.yml](./environment.yml).

#### 1- create the environment from the environment.yml file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### 2- activate the environment

`source activate meetu`
