## Introduction

This scoring method uses the following steps:

- Checking for shape complementarity and steric clashes.
- Knowledge based scoring on amino-acids interactions.
- Electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions scoring.
- Adjusting the weights of the different scoring functions by machine learning.

## Installation

### Environment - Conda

To ensure the cross-platform reproducibility of this method, we choose to work with a [conda](https://conda.io) environment.

The environment file is available here as [environment.yml](./environment.yml).

#### 1- create the environment from the environment.yml file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### 2- activate the environment

`source activate meetu`

#### 3- go to MeetDockOne folder
`cd 2017-2018_Equipe1-master`

## Quick start

```
$ ./meetdock ./data -recChain A -ligChain B -shape -electro -jones -proba
```
The folder ./data contained pdb complexes.  
The receptor is Chain A (recChain A).  
The ligand is Chain B (LigChain B).  
The following methods will be apply on the files : shape complementarity (shape), electrostatic energy (electro), Leenard-Jones interactions (jones), and a knowledge based scoring function (proba)


## Documentation

```
$ ./meetdock -h
usage: MeetDockOne [-h] [-shape] [-electro] [-jones] [-proba] [-foldx]
                   [-recChain RECCHAIN] [-ligChain LIGCHAIN] [-pH PH]
                   [-depth DEPTH] [-dist DIST]

MeetDockOne scores a protein complex docking

positional arguments:
  pdbpath             path to pdb complex directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -shape              compute shape complementarity
  -electro            compute Electrostatic interactions
  -jones              compute Lennard-Jones interactions
  -proba              Compute knowledge based interactions
  -foldx              Scores with FoldX
  -recChain RECCHAIN  receptor Chain ID. If there more than one, separate by a
                      ','. Default = 'A'
  -ligChain LIGCHAIN  ligand Chain ID. If there more than one, separate by a
                      ','. Default = 'A'
  -pH PH              pH for electrostatic interactions. Default = 7
  -depth DEPTH        Threshold for surface residue determination (Angstrom).
                      Default = 4
  -dist DIST          Threshold for interface determination (Angstrom).
                      Default = 8.5
```
## Warning  
The file 'data_handler' has been developed in order to performed machine learning. Use ./meetdock for scoring
