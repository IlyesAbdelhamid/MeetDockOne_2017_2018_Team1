## Introduction

This scoring method uses the following steps:

- Checking for shape complementarity and steric clashes.
- Knowledge based scoring on amino-acids interactions.
- Electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions scoring.
- Adjusting the weights of the different scoring functions by machine learning.

## Dependancies

- [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/)

## Download

#### 1- download the latest release of MeetDock [here](https://github.com/meetU-MasterStudents/2017-2018_Equipe1/releases/latest)

#### 2- decompress the `.zip` file

`unzip 2017-2018_Equipe1-*`

#### 3- go to MeetDockOne folder

`cd 2017-2018_Equipe1-*`

## Installation

### A- Environment - Conda

To ensure the cross-platform reproducibility of this method, we choose to work with a [conda](https://conda.io) environment.

The environment file is available here as [environment.yml](./environment.yml).

#### 1- create the environment from the environment.yml file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### 2- activate the environment

`source activate meetu`

### B- MultiThreading (optional)

We use the [Joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/) library for multiprocessing.
However, because of a [bug](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/543) in the current release of Joblib, it will not work with MeetDockOne.
To fix it, you need to install Joblib from their [Github Master branch](https://github.com/joblib/joblib):

**You must install Joblib in the conda environment while it is activated**

```
git clone https://github.com/joblib/joblib.git
cd joblib
python setup.py install
cd ..
```


## Quick start

```
$ ./meetdock ./data -recChain A -ligChain B -shape -electro -jones -proba
```
- The dictory `./data` contained pdb complexes.  
- The receptor is Chain A (`-recChain A`).  
- The ligand is Chain B (`-LigChain B`).  
- The following methods will be computed on the complexes :    
    - shape complementarity (`-shape`)
    -electrostatic energy (`-electro`)
    - Leenard-Jones interactions (`-jones`)
    - A knowledge based scoring function (`-proba`)


## Documentation

```
$ ./meetdock -h
usage: MeetDockOne [-h] [-shape] [-electro] [-jones] [-proba]

                      detection
```
## Warning  
The file 'data_handler' has been developed in order to performed machine learning. Use ./meetdock for scoring
